Introduction to Tools Exercises
-------------------------------

The following exercises cover Git, and several Unix commands typically used
alongside Git. They are intended to help you gain familiarity and build 
confidence while on the command line inside the Terminal.

The exercise folder contains this file, plus a csharp-helloworld folder.  The
csharp-helloworld folder represents a simplified C# project. (The layout of an
actual C# project will be covered in later lectures.) For now, the reduced 
structure provides an opportunity to navigate between folders, and to work with
files as you would in an actual C# project, but cleared of much of the 
clutter found in real projects.


----
1.  To begin, open your terminal, and enter the following command to change 
    directory to the exercise folder.
----

$ cd ~/exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises/csharp-helloworld

Note, do not enter the beginning "$" character. It represents the prompt for 
the command line. This convention is commonly used to visually seperate the 
actual command from other text in Unix documentation.


----
2.  What does the ~ (tilde) character in the above command to change directory 
    refer to?
----
    --**The tilda character in change directory command brings the user back to the home 
    --**home directory regardless where the user is in the file system

----
3.  A good habit to develop, especially while you're developing your skills on 
    the command line, is to confirm your location after changing directories. 
    This can be easily accomplished with the "pwd" command.
----

$ pwd
--** /c/Users/dstockham/danielstockham-c-exercises/M1W1D1-introduction-to-tools-exercises/csharp-helloworld


The present working directory displayed should match the directory you changed 
to in Exercise 1.  Note, the two may not match at the very beginning if you
used the tilde when changing directories.  The tilde is a conveniece to save 
you some typing.  The system resolves the tilde to the full location as it
changes directory, and the "pwd" command reflects this.


----
4.  Display a list of all the files and folders in your present working 
    directory. Include all dot-files and dot-folders.  Recall the "all" and
    "long format" flags for the "ls" command.
----

$ ls -la
--** ./  ../  database/  Helloworld/  Helloworld.sln


----
5.  What do the "." and ".." folders displayed in the directory listing in
    Exercise 4 represent?
----
    --** ./ represents the current directory the user is in 
    --** ../ represents the level above the current directory the user is in

----
6.  What are the names of the files, including any dot-files, displayed in the
    directory listing in Exercise 4?
----

    --** Helloworld.sln


----
7.  What are the names of the folders, including any dot-folders, displayed in 
    the directory listing in Exercise 4?
----

    --** database/  Helloworld/


----
8.  Helloworld.sln is a Visual Studio project file. You will learn more about project files in later 
    lectures. As for the exercise, it is sometimes necessary, and usually 
    always interesting to be able to view the contents of files while at the
    command line. A friendly and easy-to-use utility that allows you to do this
    is "less".  
    
    "less" has two great features. First, it is a file viewer. You never have 
    to worry about accidently modifying the file, as you would if you opened it 
    in an editor.  Second, it allows you to page-up, page-down, search, and 
    perform other nifty navigations which are really useful when files are big.

    View Helloworld.sln using "less".  

    Or, for the more adventuresome, you might want to try using "less" with a huge
    file like database/pagila.sql where the utility's navigation features really
    shine.

    Press Q to quit when you wish to stop viewing either of the files.
----

$ less Helloworld.sln

Or

$ less database/pagila.sql

You are encouraged to make "less" part of your standard command line toolkit.


----
9.  This is good time to make a Git snapshot of your progress.  Usually, 
    you'll want to check the Git status to review the list of files that
    have been changed, added, or deleted.  Then you'll want to add and commit
    those changes to your local repository.

    Don't forget to save your current changes to this text file to disk before
    making the snapshot.
----

Did you remember to save "introduction-to-tools-exercise.txt"?

$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt


$ git add .
dstockham@DESKTOP-4LJNHR2 MINGW64 ~/danielstockham-c-exercises/M1W1D1-introduction-to-tools-exercises (master)


$ git commit -m "Good stopping point"
[master 67e4fa9] added somes answers to exercise
 1 file changed, 9 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)

Note, you do not need to push this commit up to BitBucket. The typical Git 
workflow is to make many small commits to your local repo, with pushes up to 
BitBucket when a feature, fix, or in this case, assignment is finished.  


----
10.  Change into Helloworld directory under csharp-helloworld.
    Show your present working directory after the change.
----

$ cd Helloworld
$ ls -a
   --**/c/Users/dstockham/danielstockham-c-exercises/M1W1D1-introduction-to-tools-exercises/csharp-helloworld/Helloworld



----
11. Does the change directory command in Exercise 10 use a relative, or absolute
    path?
----
  
   --**It uses an absolute file path to the directory


----
12. List all the files and folders, including any dot-files or dot-folders in
    your present working directory.
----

$ ls -a
   --** ./  ../  App.config  Helloworld.csproj  Program.cs  Properties/



----
13. "Program.cs" is the sole source code file of the Helloworld application.
    Make a backup of the file named "Program.cs.backup" using the copy 
    command.
----

$ cp Program.cs Helloworld.cs.backup

The "cp" parameters are the name of the source file followed by the name of the 
destination file. 

$ ls -a
  --** App.config  Helloworld.csproj  Program.cs  Program.cs.backup  Properties/



----    
14. Rename "Program.cs.backup" to "Program.cs.copy" using the move 
    command. (There is no rename command in UNIX.)
----

$ mv Program.cs.backup Program.cs.copy

The "mv" parameters are the existing name of the file followed by the new name 
of the file. 

$ ls -a
  --** App.config  Helloworld.csproj  Program.cs  Program.cs.copy  Properties/


----
15. Let's call this a "feature completion" point in the exercises, and not only
    checkin to the local repository, but also push it up to BitBucket. 
----

$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   Program.cs.copy

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   ../../introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt


$ git add .
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   csharp-helloworld/Helloworld/Program.cs.copy
        modified:   introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt


$ git commit -m "feature complete"

----
16. Delete the backup file, "Program.cs.copy" using the remove command.
----

$ rm Program.cs.copy

The "rm" parameter is the name of the file to be deleted.

$ ls -a 
./  ../  App.config  Helloworld.csproj  Program.cs Properties/


----
17. Change directory to the csharp-helloworld folder using either one of the 
    commands shown below.
----

$ cd ..

or

$ cd ~/exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises/csharp-helloworld

Note the first alternative relies upon the ".." parent folder notation.  In 
essence it says to change directory from the current folder's parent's parent's
parent's parent's parent.  You'll know you're getting comfortable at the
command line when that seems natural.

Regardless of the option you chose, check your new location.

$ pwd
/c/Users/dstockham/danielstockham-c-exercises/M1W1D1-introduction-to-tools-exercises/csharp-helloworld


----
18. Create a documentation folder named "docs" under csharp-helloworld, and then
    change into it.
----

$ mkdir docs
$ cd docs
$ pwd
/c/Users/dstockham/danielstockham-c-exercises/M1W1D1-introduction-to-tools-exercises/csharp-helloworld/docs


----
19. Create a new file name "readme.txt" using Notepad, and add the text
    "Hello, this is the beginning of the application's documentation."
----

$ notepad readme.txt

Don't forget to save the file in Notepad!


----
20. As a final exercise, please perform the following commands to save and push your 
    work so it can be reviewed by an instructor.
----

$ git status

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "Added readme and deleted program copy file"

$ git push
